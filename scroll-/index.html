                                <p class="text-block__p">At the beginning of the story, the main character works as an insurance claims consultant for a car manufacturing company. Because of his work, he constantly travels around the country. On his travels, the hero is surrounded by disposable things and disposable people, a whole disposable world. He finds temporary relief by attending various support groups under false pretenses; but when that stops working (thanks to Marla Singer), his insomnia returns with a vengeance.</p>

                                <p class="text-block__p">The hero sells soap that is made from human fat, supposedly for a better effect. This fat is stolen from the clinic where they perform liposuction. Before that, Tyler worked at a movie theater as a mechanic and, for fun, pasted frames of pornography into family films. Even earlier, the hero worked as a waiter in a restaurant, where he added his own urine and feces to the food that was served to visitors.</p>
